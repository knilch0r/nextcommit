# nextcommit

find out what my next commit hash should be

## what?

if only there would be [a tool](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/lucky-commit)
that could get me a specific git commit hash...

I'd probably use
```
nextrc
```
to get random [hexspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak) commits or
```
nextnc
```
to just number my commits or
```
nextbc
```
to number my commits in [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)
so I can remember them without the need to squeeze magic 7-character hex
incantations into my brain.
